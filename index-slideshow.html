				# md Documentation (wiki) as a repository
Why I think is an **awesome** idea!

ðŸ˜Ž

#HSLIDE

## Keep your code close and your documentation closer
When writing documentation for code as a different task then it becomes outdated
very quickly. That&#39;s one reason of why we prefer have the documentation closer
to the code.

e.g., as docstrings in Python

```python
def greet(name):
    '''
    Generate a greeting string for a person.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
       name you want to greet

    Returns
    -------
    string
      Just a greeting
    '''
    return f"Hey, {name} how are you doing?"
```
Let&#39;s now see how this small fits with the rest of the decisions for tools and
processes.

#HSLIDE

## Format
Though it may seem silly, a familiar format to all makes a difference on its adoption.

I propose markdown, but all that I&#39;m posting here works with any of the simple
markup languages. The best part of it is that they are human readable!

```markdown
# This is a title

## and this a subtitle 

Where you **can** _write_ whatever ~~you want~~, 
and create [links to any page and within the document](#summary).
```
And when writing code snippets ðŸ‘†, it gets highlighted

##### âš 
Some tools may accept markup text as an input... <br>
but then once get rendered you lost what was used to created it.

#HSLIDE

## Automation
Either is just for searching a term (`rg`, `grep`, ...), search and replace a
word (`sed`) or test that links are still available
(`lychee`)... you&#39;d like to do so quickly, being sure you are not missing
anything.

Having plain text files where you can run these operations will make your life easier.

#HSLIDE

## Review
Code gets reviewed in all our projects, why shouldn&#39;t the documentation deserve the same honours?

Documentation under a git repository would benefit of the git-flow process.

#HSLIDE

## Contribution
For me, a wiki is a wiki if anyone can edit it. If I need to be in a particular
team and I can&#39;t update something I see it&#39;s wrong or outdated, then... what&#39;s the point?

Any git hosting platform provides ways to create contributions via pull or merge requests.

But... what about the unfamiliar with `git`? You can edit it from the website!

#HSLIDE

## Presentation
You may have guessed right already! This document is using markdown, and [lives on its own repository](https://github.com/dpshelio/wiki_as_repo/blob/main/index.md). And it can be converted easily to different types of output ([html](index.html), pdf, ...)

## Issues to keep it up to date
Sometimes we spot typos, have new ideas, or need to update things... but many
times that happens when we don&#39;t have the time to add it to the documentation.

What do we do then? we keep it in our heads, we write it a post it, we keep it for ourselves!

Using issues for that not only helps us as a reminder to do it later, but it
also warns others that there&#39;s something that needs change and even maybe
someone updates it for you!

#HSLIDE

## Summary
We use tools to write code (and sometimes documentation), the closer these tools
are to us, bigger the chances we will use it.

**We want**


- something close to most of us,
- using a familiar format,
- that we can automate if needed,
- that&#39;s easy to review,
- and easy to contribute,
- that&#39;s portable (and presentable as we like)

Having any type of documentation as plain text (`md`) within a git repository
hits all these points.
